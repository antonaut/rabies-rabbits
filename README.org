To build on Ubuntu:

Requires cmake with version >= 3.5.1.

#+begin_src sh
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
#+end_src

To run (and redirect std:cerr to a file):

#+begin_src sh
./rabiesrabbies 2>log.txt
#+end_src

Not sure how to do it on other platforms. Please consult cmake manual.


* About

This is a text game where you type commands to perform actions. Your
goal is to beat a boss called a rabbidile. It's a mix of both a rabbit
and a crocodile. Good luck.

It is made to illustrate and try out some C++ (C++11)
concepts. It uses (among other things):

 - diamond inheritance
 - lambda functions
 - auto keyword
 - const_cast
 - one dynamic_cast

...somewhere in the code.
