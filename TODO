* Death of actors

#1

Tried to make sure dead actors are removed and won't attack back.
        Keep investigating this.

    1. In GameLoop.hpp:
       After each action(), loop through the ACTORS and see if an Actor is_dead.
       If so, remove it.

    2. Created failing test case of 1.

    3. Fixed said test case and found another bug in the meantime.
       Dead enemies should always have zero hp. Not overflow. :D


#2

Crashes when more than one rabbit gets killed.

Made a really ugly way to keep track of dead enemies.
