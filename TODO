# The story of development

DONE
* Death of actors

#1

Tried to make sure dead actors are removed and won't attack back.
        Keep investigating this.

    1. In GameLoop.hpp:
       After each action(), loop through the ACTORS and see if an Actor is_dead.
       If so, remove it.

    2. Created failing test case of 1.

    3. Fixed said test case and found another bug in the meantime.
       Dead enemies should always have zero hp. Not overflow. :D


#2

    1. Crashes when more than one rabbit gets killed.
        => Got a segmentation violation when trying to access a previously not dead rabbit.
        This means that Actors don't get removed properly.

    2. Implemented a really ugly way to keep track of dead enemies.
       I use a vector to store iterators to dead-flagged actors and then erase them after having found all of them.
       This allows for death messages / events to happen before the actual delete.
       @see GameLoop.hpp

TODO

* Crocodiles

1. How do crocodiles differ from rabbits?
    a. They hurt a lot more, like twice as much. They are a lot slower.
        Let's introduce speeds:
            - FAST, means moves every second tick
            - NORMAL, means moves every third tick

    b. They live in a different environment, the swamp.
        Let's add that to the SmallForestMap.
