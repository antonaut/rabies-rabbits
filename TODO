# The story of development

This contains bugs, ideas, changes, issues etc. it's somewhat chronological from top to bottom.


DONE
* Death of actors

#1

Tried to make sure dead actors are removed and won't attack back.

    1. In GameLoop.hpp:
       After each action(), loop through the ACTORS and see if an Actor is_dead.
       If so, remove it.

    2. Created failing test case of 1.

    3. Fixed said test case and found another bug in the meantime.
       Dead enemies should always have zero hp. Not overflow.


#2

    1. Crashes when more than one rabbit gets killed.
        => Got a segmentation violation when trying to access a previously not dead rabbit.
        This means that Actors don't get removed properly.

    2. Implemented a really ugly way to keep track of dead enemies.
       I use a vector to store iterators to dead-flagged actors and then erase them after having found all of them.
       This allows for death messages / events to happen before the actual delete.
       Look in "GameLoop.hpp".


* Crocodiles

1. How do crocodiles differ from rabbits?
    a. They hurt a lot more, like twice as much. They are a lot slower.
        Let's introduce speeds:
            - FAST, means moves every second tick
            - NORMAL, means moves every third tick

    b. They live in a different environment, the swamp.
        They are pretty damn fast in the swamp.
        Let's add that to the SmallGameMap.

    c. Added more speeds.
       - PRETTY_DAMN_FAST, same as player speed.
       - SLOW, slower than normal. Rabbits are slow in the swamp.

** SwampEnvironment

1. Added EnvironmentType so we can differentiate between environments.


* Boss Rabbidile

1.  Protects the candy mountain.

    Is a combination of a Crocodile and a Rabbit.

* Items


* Memory leaks?

1. The principle of keeping 'new' and 'delete' as close as possible is violated a bit throughout this project.
   Especially with Actors.
